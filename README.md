# Sales-Analysis
Sales Analysis is an easier way to lookout for the yearly analysis of some items of the salesman.
This excel file contains the data of five salesman with their yearly sales of three items: Laptop, Mobile and Computer.
Since there were 400 rows of data it is difficult for us to analyze their sales one by one so the ease the work we made a pivot table with salesperson's name as filter and added the items as rows.
Now , suppose we want to analyze the sale of Mr. Gill we would simply filter it out.
To further represent the sales of the three items in a statistical way we made a doughnut chart to show the percentage of sales.
Slicers and timelines have also been added for further analyzing the data in an effective way.
